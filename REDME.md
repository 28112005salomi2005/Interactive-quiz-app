🧩 How It Works

1. The user starts the quiz by clicking the Start button.


2. A series of multiple-choice questions appear one by one.


3. For each question, the user selects an answer.


4. The app checks if the answer is correct and updates the score.


5. At the end, the total score is displayed with an option to retry.



Would you like me to include API documentation / JSON question data format also (for your “API document” section in the final submission)?
I can extend this README with that part too.
